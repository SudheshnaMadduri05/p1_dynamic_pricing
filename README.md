# Dynamic Pricing System
## Project Overview
This is machine learning based training model that predicts the optimal price based on ase price, demand, inventory, user type, and time of the day.This system helps businesses increase their revenue by automatically adjusting prices based on data and predictions.

## Problem Statement
Traditional pricing methods usually rely on fixed prices that don’t change with the market. Because they can’t respond to real-time demand, competition, or customer behavior, businesses often miss out on potential revenue and may struggle with inefficient inventory management.
This project addresses that issue by introducing a dynamic pricing system that automatically adjusts prices based on various influencing factors. As market conditions change, the system adapts, helping businesses make smarter decisions and improve overall performance.


## Features

- Predicts optimal price based on demand, inventory, user type, and time of day
- Implemented using Linear Regression algorithm
- Automatic price updates every 30 minutes
- Machine learning-based pricing prediction model
- Pricing lock mechanism to avoid extreme fluctuations
- Modular and clean project structure

## Innovation Feature

This project introduces an automated time-based pricing mechanism where prices are recalculated every 30 minutes using updated system conditions.
It also includes a smart pricing lock feature that prevents sudden or extreme changes in prices, helping maintain stability and fairness. This ensures that pricing decisions remain practical, reliable, and business-friendly.
Together, these features make the system more realistic, trustworthy, and well-suited for real-world business use.
